WELCOME TO THE SUBGROUP_01 PROJECT

Project developed for the subject fundamental concepts of programming, group B03, subgroup 1.

In this first part of the code, the program reads a file called salespeople.txt, which contains the salespeople's information, separated by semicolons on each line. Then, it splits each line into parts using the .split(“;”) method and extracts the salesperson's document number as the identifier and the first name along with the last name concatenated as the full name. 

With this information, the program calls the createSalesMenFile() function, which generates individual sales files for each salesperson. Each file has the salesperson's ID on the first line and, on the following lines, a set of products sold along with the corresponding quantities. These files are stored in the same project folder and will serve as input for the second part of the program, which will process the data and generate reports.
